I'm a first-year Collaborative Ph.D. student from [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) and [Eastern Institute of Technology (EIT)](https://www.eitech.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Changwen Chen](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-chen-changwen/?sc_lang=en) from PolyU and [Assistant Prof. Xin Jin](https://www.eitech.edu.cn/?tid=40&p=teacher) from EIT. Before that, I received my M.E. degree in Computer Technology from the [University of Science & Technology of China (USTC)](http://saids.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) under the supervision of [Prof. Hong Zhang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/chinese/profile-392.html), and I obtained my B.E degree in Software Engineering from the Dalian University (DLU).

My research interests cover topics in Visual Coding for Machines and Coding for MLLM, with a particular focus on video coding and multimodel understanding. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in related topics :)
